# FNA as a Unity Developer

Documentation of my own experience with moving to FNA for game development, after years with Unity.

The goal here is to document common things that I would do with Unity, but with FNA. It's basically me following along with the FNA wiki tutorials or other tutorials, but providing additional writing if any of those steps seem confusing or vague or unclear _to me_. 

I'm a teacher, after all - if I don't understand it, how the heck am I supposed to teach it to others?

	- How to set up FNA on your development machine and make your first game project or game engine project.


## Wishlist / Future Items

I'm still learning FNA myself, but this is what I want to learn ASAP so I can confidently say "bye bye, Unity" and move to any other engine or library, such as FNA.

- 3D Platformer
	- Building a 3D platformer with basic cubes, capsules, spheres, etc, is a common introductory lesson that I would do via Unity. 
	- There's numerous 2D engines out there, numerous 2D tutorials out there. 3D FNA stuff seems a bit rarer?
- User interfaces
	- Menus that can react to user input and trigger functions based on that input.
- Building for standard platforms
	- Making a polished, distributable build is the key step that lengthy tutorial series often leave out. But it's the step that turns a game from a hobby into a product!
	- Executable dress-up (eg. icons, metadata) for Windows, MacOS
